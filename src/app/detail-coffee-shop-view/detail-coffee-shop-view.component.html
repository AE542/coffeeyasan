                to get some work done. They get new beans in every month and also have a wide variety of cakes and food available.
                The location is right next to Southwark station with London Bridge not too far away.
                The staff are very knowledgeable about beans and give good recommendations whenever you ask.
                Wifi speed and stability is good here so a good place to work a little while enjoying some high quality coffee.
                Their app also is really good for saving points and using them for free coffee when you have enough.
