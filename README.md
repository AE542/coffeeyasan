# Coffee Ya San!

This is a repo for building a coffee shop app, detailing coffee shops around London. 

Technologies
Front-End:
Angular
Vanilla JS
Backend:
Node.js
Database:
MySQL (Through Google Cloud)

Integrations for:

Google Maps
Buy Me a Coffee API
YouTube Angular component

Requirements:

Node version 18 or above

To run this project:

First run the mysqldatabase.js with the node mysqldatabase.js in the backend folder to set up a local server 3000 with the json data.

Then in the main coffee-shop-angular project, run npm run start (the start script allows running the server through a proxy).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build



Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
